                      I am a mother of two kids. I have graduated from Cal State 
                      Easy Bay Hayward with a master’s degree in Computer Science. I worked at Big Machines
                      ( which is now acquired by Oracle) as an Implementation Engineer for a year. I left 
                      my job because of complications during my pregnancy. I stayed home and continued to take 
                      care of my kids and family for past ten years. 
                  </p>
  
                  <p class="text-justify">I have volunteered at my kids school from past seven years and am 
                      working as an instructional-aide for past three years. Working at school helped me stay 
                      closer to my kids. I have now decided to get back to my career and I am updating myself 
                      with the latest technologies in the industry.
